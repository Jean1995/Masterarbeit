\section{Muon pair production}

The process of muon pair production is a rare process with a negligible contribution to the overall energy loss of a propagated particle.
Although quantitatively negligible, the created signatures may be qualitatively relevant for neutrino observatories such as IceCube or underground detectors examining muons, see chapter \ref{sec:signatures} for a description of these signatures.

\subsection{Theoretical description}

Muon pair production describes the creation of a muon-antimuon pair by an particle in the field of an atom nucleus $Z$, for example in case of an initial muon the reaction is
\begin{align*}
    \mu^- + Z \rightarrow \mu^- + \mu^+ + \mu^- + Z.
\end{align*}
A feynman diagram in leading order for the process is shown in figure \ref{fig:feynman_mupair}.

    \caption{One possible feynman diagram describing the creation of a muon pair by an ingoing muon.}
    \label{fig:feynman_mupair}
\end{figure}

The process has been described in \cite{Kelner2000} where a simplified analytical double-differential cross section for is given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:mupair}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}^2\sigma}{\mathrm{d}v \mathrm{d}\rho} = \frac{2}{3\pi} (Z \alpha r_\mu)^2 \frac{1-v}{v} \Phi(v, \rho) \ln \left( X \left(E, v, \rho \right) \right)
\end{equation}
with the relative energy loss $v$ and the asymmetry parameter $\rho$ defined by
\begin{align}
    v &= \frac{E_+ + E_-}{E}, & \rho &= \frac{E_+ - E_-}{E_+ + E_-}
\end{align}
and the energy of the produced (anti)muon $E_+$, $E_-$.
The functions $\Phi(v, \rho)$ and $X(E, v, \rho)$ have the form
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
    \Phi(v, \rho) &= \left[ (2 + \rho^2) (1 + \beta) + \xi (3 + \rho^2) \right] \cdot \ln{ \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\xi} \right) }\\ &+ \left[ (1 + \rho^2) \left( 1 + \frac{3}{2} \beta \right) - \frac{1}{\xi} (1 + 2 \beta) (1 - \rho^2) \right] \cdot \ln{ (1 + \xi) }\\ &- 1 - 3 \rho^2 + \beta (1 - 2 \rho^2)
    \end{split}
\end{align}
where $X$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    X = 1 + U(E, v, \rho) - U(E, v, \rho_\text{max})
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
    U(E, v, \rho) = \frac{\frac{0.65 m_{\mu}}{m_e} A^{-0.27} B Z^{-\sfrac{1}{3}}}{1 + \frac{2 \sqrt{e} \mu^2 B Z^{-\sfrac{1}{3}} (1 + \xi) (1 + Y) }{m_e E v (1 - \rho^2)} }
\end{equation}
and with 
\begin{align}
    \xi &= \frac{v^2 (1 - \rho^2)}{4 (1 - v)}, & \beta &= \frac{v^2}{2 (1 - v)}, & Y &= 12 \sqrt{\frac{m_{\mu}}{E}}, & B &= 183.
\end{align}

The approximative expression \eqref{eqn:mupair} takes into account the finiteness of the nucleus as well as screening effects of the nucleus by atomic electrons.
A more precise formula for the differential cross section is given in \cite{Kelner2000} as well, however it includes multidimensional integrals that are hard to evaluate and is therefore not suited to be used here.
Furthermore, \eqref{eqn:mupair} is chosen to have a discrepancy compared to the precise formula of below $\SI{10}{\percent}$ for all $E > \SI{e4}{\mega\electronvolt}$, the discrepancy of the derived total cross section is even below $\SI{3}{\percent}$ for $E > \SI{3e4}{\mega\electronvolt}$.

The kinematic limits of the process for $v$ and $\rho$ are
%
\begin{align}
    v_\text{min} &= \frac{2 m_{\mu}}{E}, & v_\text{max} &= 1 - \frac{m}{E}, & \left| \rho \right| \leq \rho_{\text{max}} &= 1 - \frac{2 m_{\mu}}{v E},
\end{align}
%
for an initial particle with mass $m$ and are easy to retrace by demanding the condition that all particles involved have to fulfill $E > m_{\text{rest}}$ at all times.

\subsection{Implementation in PROPOSAL}
\label{sec:mupair_implementation}

% sloppypar is needed here because otherwise \texttt{...} breaks the layout because it cant use hyphenation here
\begin{sloppypar}
The process of muon pair production is implemented as an optional, additional interaction in PROPOSAL.
It is per default disabled in PROPOSAL and can be enabled by setting the keyword \texttt{mupair} in the configuration file to \texttt{MupairKelnerKokoulinPetrukhin} which is the parametrization that has been described in the previous chapter.
\end{sloppypar}

\begin{sloppypar}
To obtain the single-differential cross section in $v$ from \eqref{eqn:mupair}, a numerical integration across the entire kinematic range of $\rho$
%
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\symup{d}\sigma}{\symup{d}v} = \int_{\rho_{\text{min}}}^{\rho_{\text{max}}} \frac{\mathrm{d}^2\sigma}{\mathrm{d}v \mathrm{d}\rho} \, \symup{d}\rho
\end{equation}
%
is performed in PROPOSAL.
After sampling the relative energy loss $v$ during propagation according to \eqref{eqn:sample_v}, the asymmetry parameter $\rho$ is also sampled when setting to \texttt{mupair\_particle\_output} parameter to \texttt{True}.
In this case, \eqref{eqn:mupair} is used with a fixed $v$ to solve the integral equation
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\sigma} \int_{\rho_\text{min}}^{\rho} \frac{\mathrm{d}^2\sigma}{\mathrm{d}v \mathrm{d}\rho} \, \symup{d}\rho = \xi
\end{equation}
for $\rho$ where $\xi \in \left[0,1\right)$ is a random number and $\sigma$ the result of the integration over the entire kinematic range of $\rho$.
An additional random number is used to decide on the sign of $\rho$, the muon energies then assigned are $E_{\pm} = v E \cdot(1 \pm \rho)$.
In figure \ref{fig:rho_mupair}, the behavior of $\rho$ for different muon energies and different $v$ is shown.
For high energies, the process tends to have a higher asymmetry $\rho$, especially when a high relative energy loss is involved while for lower energies, lower asymmetries are favored.
\end{sloppypar}

    \includegraphics[scale=1]{build/mupair_rho.pdf}
    \caption{Histogram of $\lvert\rho\rvert$ for different $v$ of muons in ice. For each $v$, $\rho$ has been sampled $\num{e6}$ times. The dashed curves correspond to an initial muon energy of $E=\SI{e4}{\mega\electronvolt}$, the solid curves to $E = \SI{e9}{\mega\electronvolt}$.}
    \label{fig:rho_mupair}
\end{figure}

A comparison of the average energy loss in ice due to electron-positron pair production and muon pair production is shown in figure \ref{fig:dEdx_mupair}.
Both functions behave similarly as the grow linearly with $E$, still the contribution from muon pair production is by about three orders of magnitudes lower for higher energies and even lower for small energies.
This observation shows that the process is negligible for the energy loss for the muon which is especially a result of the difference between the muon mass and the electron mass since 
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\sigma_{\mu \text{pair}}}{\sigma_{e \text{pair}}} \propto \frac{r_{\mu}^2}{r_e^2} \propto \frac{m_e^2}{m_{\mu}^2} \propto \num{2e-5}.
\end{align*}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:spectrum_mupair} shows a secondary particle spectrum where muon pair production is enabled.
The contribution for muon pair production tends to be distributed homogeneously but is, as expected, quantitatively negligible for all secondary energies.

The histogram shows the frequency of the stochastic losses during propagation, classified by the type of energy loss. The energy cuts applied here are $e_\text{cut} = \SI{500}{\mega\electronvolt}$, $v_\text{cut} = 0.05$.}

\subsection{Significant detector signatures}
\label{sec:signatures}

As already described and shown in chapter \ref{sec:mupair_implementation}, the contribution of muon pair production to the overall energy loss of muons is negligible.
For detectors working with muons however, the effects of muon pair production may portray a source of significant signatures.
In the following, a group of muon moving into almost the same direction with only a small separation is called a muon bundle.
The origin of such a bundle can be muon pair production, in this case the bundle consists of three muons.

\textbf{IceCube detector}

Due to resolution effects, the IceCube detector is unable to identify the muons in a bundle as individual muon signatures.
However, the signature of a single muon traversing the detector is different from a muon bundle originating from muon pair production with the same sum of energy.
The signature of a high-energetic muon in IceCube is often characterized by a single high-energetic stochastic energy loss creating a spherical signature.
In a muon bundle, each muon with only a fraction of the total energy produces smaller stochastic losses.
Since the stochastic losses of the individual muons in the bundle are independent of each other, the resulting signature is homogeneous and the energy loss per distance of a bundle is more consistent compared to a single muon with the same total energy. \todo{Include an event signature of a high-energetic muon and a muon bundle event? See Tomasz dissertation as a comparison.}

\textbf{Underground observatories}

Underground detectors observing muons originating from extensive air showers can use the information about muon bundles created in these air showers to learn about the cosmic ray composition and hadronic interaction models.
This is done by comparing the frequency and multiplicity of muon bundles as well as the muon separation measured in experiments with the predictions from Monte Carlo studies.
In \cite{MupairInRock}, the authors describe this procedure in more detail and point out a possible background from muon pair production.

While about $\SI{1}{\percent}$ to $\SI{10}{\percent}$ of the observed muons are muon bundles induced in the air shower, these bundles can also be produced due to muon pair production in rock or water above the underground detector.
According to calculations in \cite{MupairInRock}, these bundles induced by muon pair production can portray a background of up to $\SI{10}{\percent}$ compared to the conventional bundles in the showers, although more exact calculations have to be performed individually for each experiment with its own geometric properties.
Due to the difference in the distance between the creation and observation point of the muon bundle, both effects can be separated statistically by examining the separation distance in the bundle.
The separation of muon bundles due to muon pair production is mostly below $\SI{1}{\metre}$ while for muon bundles induced in air showers, only a small percentage of muon bundles have such a small separation \cite{MupairInRock}.
